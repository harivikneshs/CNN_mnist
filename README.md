# Machine learning projects

1.CNN_MNIST contains code for fetching data and training Deep Learning model for recognising Handwritten digits using MNIST dataset. It uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), implimented using Keras library and runs directly on Google Colaboratory

2.Simple sentiment analysis is a ml model using Naive Bayes classifier with tfidf vectoriser to classify tweets as positive or negative using sentiment140 dataset from kaggle, This is a cloned version of kernel from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/harivikneshs/simple-sentiment-analysis-using-nb-and-tfidf
