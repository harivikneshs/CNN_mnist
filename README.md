# Deep-Learning
This repository constains .py/.ipynb files of my deep learning models developed as a part of my learning journey towads Deep Learning/Neural networks

CNN_MNIST contains code for fetching data and training Deep Learning model for recognising Handwritten digits using MNIST dataset. It uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), implimented using Keras library and runs directly on Google Colaboratory
